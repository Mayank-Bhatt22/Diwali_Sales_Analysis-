# Diwali_Sales_Analysis-
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of Diwali sales data to uncover insights about customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and popular product categories. Using Python, I performed data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to derive insights that can help businesses make data-driven decisions.

Key Steps and Insights
Data Import and Preprocessing:

Imported necessary libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Loaded the dataset, checked its shape and initial structure, and dropped unnecessary columns.
Handled missing values by removing rows with null values to ensure clean data.
Converted the Amount column to integer data type to facilitate accurate analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Gender Analysis: Created visualizations to analyze sales based on gender. Found that females were the primary buyers and had a higher purchasing power compared to males.
Age Group Analysis: Analyzed age groups, revealing that individuals aged 26-35 were the most frequent buyers, especially among females.
State-wise Analysis: Identified top states in terms of orders and sales amounts, with Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka leading in sales volume and revenue.
Marital Status and Gender Insights: Analyzed purchasing trends based on marital status, finding that married women had higher purchasing power.
Occupation-based Insights: Examined the buyers' occupations, highlighting that professionals in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation were the highest spenders.
Product Category Analysis: Analyzed product preferences, showing that Food, Clothing, and Electronics were the most popular categories among customers.
Conclusion and Business Insights:

The data suggests that married women in the age group of 26-35 from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, working in sectors like IT, Healthcare, and Aviation, are more likely to make purchases, especially in the Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories.
This project showcases my ability to clean, manipulate, and analyze data to extract meaningful business insights. By using visualizations, I communicated these insights effectively, demonstrating the purchasing patterns of various customer segments. This analysis can help businesses target specific demographics and optimize their marketing strategies for better engagement and sales.
